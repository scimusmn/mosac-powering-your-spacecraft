        <!-- Customized battery multipliers, to allow for different sized solar arrays per component -->
        <!-- These settings adjust the readings of the battery voltage from the arduino.
              The readings from the arduino are integer values between 0 and 1024.
              batteryOffset sets the voltage value that is recorded as 0 on the display battery
              batteryScale divides the offset-adjusted, to make the hardware.battery value between 0 and 100

              To calibrate these values, uncomment the NOTE line in the hardware.init function,
              and watch the values reported in the javascript console in the browser.

              The batteryOffset value should be set to the reported voltage about 1/3 of the way through
              the night pass with all devices on battery power.

              The batterScale value should be set to the maximum voltage reported (at the end of a day pass)
              minus the batteryOffset value, and divided by 100

              Example:  with all devices set on battery power, the console is reporting
              a value of 260, 1/3 of the way through the night.
              Hence, batteryOffset is set to 260.

              With no devices turned on for a full day cycle, the console reports
              a value of 535. 535- batteryOffset (260) = 275, and so the
              batteryScale value is set to 2.75.
